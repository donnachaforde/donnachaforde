### Hi there! 👋 - I'm Donnacha. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

Perhaps the best place to start is at my GitHub.io page [here](https://donnachaforde.github.io) where I outline details on code examples, posts & blogs and my lecture contents.

If you're just checking out my profile, the best place is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnachaforde/).

If you're checking out my code, then unfortunately, my best work is behind private repos and you'll just have to make do with some simple tools and example code... 😁
